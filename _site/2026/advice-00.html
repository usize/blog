<p>I’m a sucker for frameworks. Not UI frameworks, decision frameworks. Guidelines, north stars, decision trees… you name it–and the simpler, the better.</p>

<p>When I encounter a good one it gets stuck in my head and becomes a part of my little repertoire, like a Pokémon card.</p>

<p>One that I think about often is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The best projects are ones where you’d be happy if you found out that somebody had already done it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back when I encountered it–at a Mozilla all-hands party in 2015–it seemed like a more sophisticated version of “scratch your own itch.”</p>

<p>But today, when a coding agent can help me knock-out the sorts of scratch projects that would usually be abandoned after a barebones prototype it’s taken on a new meaning.</p>

<p>Thanks to coding assistants, the payoff from doodling around to learn a new framework is lower than ever.</p>

<p>At the same time, knowing what to work on seems like it might be more valuable than ever.</p>

<p>For hobby projects in particular, this is not necessarily something economically productive or something technically impressive.</p>

<p>Just something that does a thing that’s worth doing. To the point that you’re happy that it exists, even if you didn’t do it yourself.</p>

<p>Because finding things like that is probably a muscle that you can train, just like anything else.</p>
