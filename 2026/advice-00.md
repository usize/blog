# The Most Useful Heuristic 

#### [usize](https://github.com/usize) Jan 2026

During the first evening of Mozilla's [2015 all-hands](https://wiki.mozilla.org/All_Hands/2015_Whistler) I was mingling my way through a mixer when I struck up a conversation with a very fascinating and delightful individual. 

Many of their comments were so thoughtful that they had the quality of stack frames piling up until they struck a base case and collapsed into a coherent thesis. 

And as our conversation wound down, when I reached for one of the stock questions that I use to avoid awkwardly abrupt dead space in social functions.

> "What's a guiding principle you live by?"

I received a similarly well-structured response.

> "**Never work on something unless you'd be happy to find out that somebody else already did it for you.**"

It's saying something more than "don't re-invent the wheel."

It's saying:

> "It feels good to be the person who does a thing. It makes you proud of yourself. But it doesn't scale."

They'd learned this lesson by running clubs in university and quickly becoming overwhelmed with commitments. 

Which is exactly right. A leader doing hands on work insted of delegating is often a failure mode.

But there's something even more interesting here, beyond the scope of encouraging delegation.

It updates the common heuristic of 

`do_the_thing = feels_good && has_not_beed_done_yet` 

with an additional predicate: `&& is_worthwhile`

where `is_worthwhile = happy_if_it_already_exists`.

The genius is that this reframes the decision in terms of expected real-world utility, not personal satisfaction.

It's pushing us away from "[hill-climbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing)" our way toward low-utility work that can come by simply chasing a first-order sense of accomplishment.

I've applied this heuristic in my own life many times over the past 11 years.

Of course, there are cases where it fails:

  - When a thing clearly needs to exist, but nobody has done it because it's difficult `||` scary `||` painful.
  - When grinding for short term recognition necessary to build credibility and leverage.

But when I've been able to follow it, it's served me well.

It might even count as the best piece of advice I've ever gotten.
