#  "Never work on something unless you'd be happy to find out that somebody else already did it for you."

#### [usize](https://github.com/usize) Jan 2026

During the first evening of Mozilla's [2015 all-hands](https://wiki.mozilla.org/All_Hands/2015_Whistler) I was mingling my way through a mixer when I struck up a conversation with a very fascinating and delightful individual. 

They had a certain "with-it-ness", like, when they spoke about their work it had the quality of stack frames piling up until they struck a base case and collapsed into a coherent thesis. 

And as our conversation wound down, when I reached for one of the stock questions that I use to avoid awkwardly abrupt dead space in social functions.

> "What's a guiding principle you live by?"

I received a similarly well-structured response.

> "**Never work on something unless you'd be happy to find out that somebody else already did it for you.**"

Which was a really interesting response.

Because it says something more than the cliché "don't re-invent the wheel."

It's says:

> "It feels good to be the person who does a thing. It makes you proud of yourself. But it doesn't scale."

They'd learned this lesson by running clubs in university and quickly becoming overwhelmed with commitments. 

But there's also something here beyond the scope of delegation.

It updates the common heuristic of 

`do_the_thing = feels_good && has_not_been_done_yet` 

with an additional predicate: `&& is_worthwhile`

where `is_worthwhile = happy_if_it_already_exists`.

The genius is that this reframes the decision in terms of real-world utility.

That sometimes the destination matters more than the journey.

It's something I've thought about often over the years during times when I needed to figure out what's worth doing.

There are cases where it fails/doesn't apply:

  - When you wouldn't be happy if a thing existed already because you're looking for a competative edge.
  - When grinding on low-novelty problems is necessary to build credibility, skills or leverage.
  - When you're optimizing for joy over utility. 

Less than a year later I failed to follow this advice when I volunteered to re-write some standard library methods in JavaScript that truthfully did not impact my life directly. And I still feel happy that I did, because it was _cool_.

But when I've been able to follow it in work settings, it's served me well.

It's helped me to:

  - Avoid the sort of high-complexity (nerd cred) low reward work that haunts many issue trackers.
  - Recognize opportunities to hand off tasks to people with more 'skin in the game' concerning outcomes.

And I believe that this is still useful during this era when LLMs have made it so cheap to explore that space of all possible widgets that could be built.

Because it's more tempting than ever to bury yourself in a mountain of high-complexity low-utility projects because it feels cheap, but is it?

You're still paying with your attention. Creating sprawl. Inviting the opportunity for scope creep to create an energy sink.

Weighting the cheapness of code too highly is just another way of valuing the journey more than the destination.
